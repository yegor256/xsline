/**
 * A {@link Shift} repeated a few times, until changes are happening.
 *
 * <p>Sometimes it's necessary to apply the same XSL a number of times
 * to the same XML document, making repetitive changes until they stop
 * making sense (stop modifying the document). For example, an XSL stylesheet
 * is removing some elements from the XML and adds new elements. The second
 * run of the same XSL will again remove something and add something new,
 * and so on. This class will help you implement this logic:</p>
 *
 * <pre> new StEndless(new StClasspath("test.xsl"))</pre>
 *
 * <p>This class will never stop, if each application of the XSL do make
 * some changes to the XML. That's why, be aware of a risk of a potential
 * totally endless cycle.</p>
